Extracting the values separated by comma
Shell Programming and Scripting
Think that cut with use of:
  -d, --delimiter=DELIM
      use DELIM instead of TAB for field delimiter
  -f, --fields=LIST
      select only these fields;  also print any line that contains  no
      delimiter character, unless the -s option is specified
Is the easiest method.
