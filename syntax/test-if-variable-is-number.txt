Test if variable is number


One approach is to use a regular expression, like so:
  re='^[0-9]+$'
  if ! [[ $yournumber =~ $re ]] ; then
     echo "error: Not a number" >&2; exit 1
  fi

If the value is not necessarily an integer, consider amending\
the regex appropriately; for instance:

  ^[0-9]+([.][0-9]+)?$
  ...or, to handle numbers with a sign:

  ^[+-]?[0-9]+([.][0-9]+)?$
