Format string
=============
"You provide printf with a format string and a list of values.
It then replaces the %... sequences in the string with the values
from the list formatted according to the format specification
(the part following the percent sign).  There are a dozen or more
format specifier characters, but 99% of the time, the only ones
you'll need are the following:

o d - Format a value as a signed decimal number.
o u - Format a value as an unsigned decimal number.
o x - Format a value as a hexadecimal number with lower case a-f.
o X - Format a value as a hexadecimal number with upper case A-F.
o s - Format a value as a number [edit: correction, as a "string"].

Format specifiers can be preceded by a field width to specify the
minimum number of characters to print.  A positive width causes the
value to be right-justified; a negative width causes the value to
be left-justiifed.  A width with a leading zero causes numeric
fields to be zero-filled.  Usually, you want to use negative widths
for strings and positive widths for numbers."[1]


Examples
========
$ printf "foo %s\n" "bar"
foo bar
$

$ printf "foo 10%s\n" "bar"
foo bar
$

$ printf "foo%10s\n" "bar"
foo       bar
$ 

$ printf "%10s%10s\n" "foo" "bar"
       foo       bar
$ 

Good stuff
