bash exec command


Does not fork
=============
The exec shell builtin replaces the current process with a specified command.
Normally, when the shell encounters a command, it forks off a child process to
actually execute the command.  Using the exec builtin, the shell does not fork,
and the command exec'ed replaces the shell.  When used in a script, therefore,
it forces an exit from the script when the exec'ed command terminates.  For
this reason, if an exec appears in a script, it would probably be the final
command, and the last lines of your script would never run.

To work around this limitation, try putting the exec command by itself in
another executable script, and call that script instead of using the exec
command.  When the other script finishes, the exit from that script might
return execution to the script that called it.
