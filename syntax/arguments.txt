Arguments


Iterate over arguements
=======================
"Use "$@" to represent all the arguments

for var in "$@"
do
    echo "$var"
done

This will iterate over each argument and print it out on
a separate line. $@ behaves like $* except that when quoted
the arguments are broken up properly if there are spaces in
them:

sh test.sh 1 2 '3 4'
1
2
3 4
