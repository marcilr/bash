stat - display file or file system status


The question is how to identify files or directories
that have recently started to use a lot more space.
The stat program can certainly be used to get the
modification time.



stat tells you various information about the file including
the last modified date.

At first, I was confused with Modify and Change, just to clarify,
stat output lists:

  Access shows the time of last data access (e.g. read).
  Modify shows the time of last data modification.
  Change shows the time the file status last changed.


Another way that is more flexible is using date -r. From man date:

  -r, --reference=FILE
         display the last modification time of FILE

This has the advantage of allowing you to specify the output format, e.g.

  $ date -r foo
  Thu Aug 31 10:36:28 AEST 2017
  $ date -r foo -R
  Thu, 31 Aug 2017 10:36:28 +1000
  $ date -r foo -u
  Thu Aug 31 00:36:28 UTC 2017
  $ date -r foo +%s
