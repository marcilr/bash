How to get file creation date/time in Bash/Debian?

Interestingly the file system does not keep the creation date.

Each file has three distinct associated timestamps: the time of last data
access, the time of last data modification, and the time the file status last
changed.  These values are returned in the file characteristics structure
struct stat, as described in .

mikyra's answer is good.The fact just like what he said.

[jason@rh5 test]$ stat test.txt
  File: `test.txt'
  Size: 0               Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   regular empty file
Device: 802h/2050d      Inode: 588720      Links: 1

Access: 2013-03-14 01:58:12.000000000 -0700
Modify: 2013-03-14 01:58:12.000000000 -0700
Change: 2013-03-14 01:58:12.000000000 -0700

if you want to verify wich file was created first, you can structure your file
name by appending system date when you create a series of files.
