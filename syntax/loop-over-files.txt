Loop over files using find


First of all, this structure sometimes may cause problems:

  find $source_dir -name *.$input_file_type | while read in_file
  do
      ...
      ...
  done

Our forum's bash expert extraordinaire sisco311 recommended this
other structure, and it's been working really well for me:

  while IFS= read -d '' -r in_file
  do
      ...
      ...
  done< <(find $source_dir -name *.$input_file_type -print0)

Besides a tighter integration between 'while' and 'find', it is
also safer when filenames have none standard characters on them.

where
  -iname is like -name but case insensitive, so it could find
   both file.mkv and FILE.MKV,for instance.

  -o is a logical 'or'.
