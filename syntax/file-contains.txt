How to check if a file contains a specific string using bash

  if grep -q SomeString "$File"; then
    Some Actions
  fi

You don't need [[ ]] here.  Just run the command directly.  Add -q option when
you don't need the string displayed when it was found.

The grep command returns 0 or 1 in the exit code depending on the result of
search.  0 if something was found; 1 otherwise.

  $ echo hello | grep hi ; echo $?
  1
  $ echo hello | grep he ; echo $?
  hello
  0
  $ echo hello | grep -q he ; echo $?
  0

You can specify commands as an condition of if.  If the command returns 0 in
its exitcode that means that the condition is true; otherwise false.

  $ if /bin/true; then echo that is true; fi
  that is true
  $ if /bin/false; then echo that is true; fi
  $
