How do I match a numeric string in a bash case statement
# this is very clumsy, but works in all POSIX shells
isNum() {
  case $1 in [0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9])           : "Matched 5" ;;
             [0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9])      : "Matched 6" ;;
             [0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]) : "Matched 7" ;;
             *) return ;;
  esac
  echo "Got it!" # only reached if the "return" didn't happen
}
