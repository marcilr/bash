Command line syntax


This document uses the following special characters to define the command
syntax:

[ ]     Identifies an optional argument. Arguments not enclosed in brackets
        are required. 

...     Indicates that you can specify multiple values for the previous
        argument. 

|       Indicates mutually exclusive information. You can use the argument
        to the left of the separator or the argument to the right of the
        separator. You cannot use both arguments in a single use of the
        command.
 
{ }     Delimits a set of mutually exclusive arguments when one of the
        arguments is required.  If the arguments are optional, they are
        enclosed in brackets ([ ]). 

Notes:
  The maximum number of characters in an argument is 256.
  Enclose argument values that have embedded spaces with either single
  or double quotation marks.

For example:
  wsetsrc [-S server] [-l label] [-n name] source

The source argument is the only required argument for the wsetsrc command.
The brackets around the other arguments indicate that these arguments are
optional.

Another example is the wlsac command:
  wlsac [-l | -f format] [key... ] profile

In this example, the -l and -f format arguments are mutually exclusive and
optional.  The profile argument is required.  The key argument is optional.
Also, the ellipsis marks (...) following the key argument indicate that you
can specify multiple key names.

Another example is the wrb -import command:
  wrb -import {rule_pack | rule_set} ...

In this example, the rule_pack and rule_set arguments are mutually
exclusive, but one of the arguments must be specified.  Also, the
ellipsis marks (...) indicate that you can specify multiple
rule packs or rule sets.
