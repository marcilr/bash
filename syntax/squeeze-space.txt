Squeeze space


To squeeze multiple spaces to a single space in bash use:
  tr -s [:blank:]


Examples
========
awk version is probably the best way to go, but you can also use cut
if you firstly squeeze the repeats with tr:

ps axu | grep jbos[s] | tr -s ' ' | cut -d' ' -f5
#        ^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#              |            |             |
#              |            |       get 5th field
#              |            |
#              |        squeeze spaces
#              |
#        avoid grep itself to appear in the list

I like to use the tr -s command for this

   ps aux | tr -s [:blank:] | cut -d' ' -f3

This squeezes all white spaces down to 1 space.  This way telling
cut to use a space as a delimiter is honored as expected.
