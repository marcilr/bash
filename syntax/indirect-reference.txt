Indirect reference - Variable to access a variable


Indirect referencing in Bash is a multi-step process.  First,
take the name of a variable: varname.  Then, reference it:
$varname.  Then, reference the reference: $$varname.  Then,
escape the first $: \$$varname.  Finally, force a reevaluation
of the expression and assign it: eval newvar=\$$varname.

Think I like the "${!num}" syntax better:
  newvar="${!num}"

Fine ${!num} syntax for indirect references.

We have seen that referencing a variable, $var, fetches its value.
But, what about the value of a value? What about $$var?
